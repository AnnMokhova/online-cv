    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Freshly graduated with a Master’s degree in Language and Science Technologies 
      and Language and Communication Technologies. I possess a keen understanding of 
      the intersection between linguistics and computer science.  With a solid 
      foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of computational linguistics, 
      I am eager to apply my skills to a forward-thinking organization or academic 
      institution where innovative solutions are valued. Analytical thinking, 
      Adaptability, Organization, Problem Solving, Communication, Teamwork, Flexibility 
      and  Time management are some of my other soft skills.
